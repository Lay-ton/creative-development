## Getting the environment set up
  * Make sure you have node installed!
  * If you don't have **postgresql** go get it setup following this: https://postgresapp.com/
  * Clone the repo .
  * cd into both `/client` and `/server` in different terminal tabs.
  * Run `npm install` in both directories.
  * You'll need to edit the file `/server/configs/db.config.js` to match up with your postgres credentials and database.
  * At this point you should be good to go. You will need to populate the database on your own for now.
  * Run `npm start` in both `/client` and `/server`.
