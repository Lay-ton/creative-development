## Getting the environment set up
  * Make sure you have node installed!
  * If you don't have **mongoDB** you can set it up using Mongo Cloud Atlas cluster: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
  * Clone the repo .
  * cd into both `/client` and `/server` in different terminal tabs.
  * Run `npm install` in both directories.
  * You'll need to edit the file `/server/configs/db.config.js` to match up with your MongoDB credentials and database.
  * At this point you should be good to go. You will need to populate the database on your own for now.
  * Run `npm start` in both `/client` and `/server`.
